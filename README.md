# Portfolio 1

This uses the menu from week 6. The two new components are:
1.) OrderFood in OrderFood.js, which allows users to select what items they want from the menu and the quantity using buttons.
2.) Survey in Survey.js, which uses a TextInput to collect an email address and another TextInput to collect any comments. Additionally, users are able to rate their experience using buttons. 


The styling for the buttons in OrderFood is based on the example from https://reactnative.dev/docs/button

Until I get the GitHub Pages running, here is a link to the expo snack that I used for testing:
